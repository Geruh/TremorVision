@Description: Webpage interface which allows users to submit hand-drawn spirals in the canvas box to check for Parkinson's tremors.
@tools: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Azure Custom Vision AI

How to draw your spiral:
1. Open the webpage: https://geruh.github.io/TremorVision/ on a touchscreen device, guaranteed to work on Chrome browser.
2. Click the "Get started" button highlighted in a green box
3. You will see a spiral, this is your guide. Trace your finger from the center of the spiral out try your best to follow the spiral. Once you have completed drawing the spiral, lift your finger from the canvas box.
4. Click on "Evaluate" button highlighted in a green box.
5. Your results should come momentarily, if you exhibit healthy symptoms your message will read: "Our model shows you're healthy". If you exhibit Parkinson's like symptoms, your message will read "You're exhibiting symptoms of Parkison's"
6. Try to get the Parkinson's message.
7. Click the "Clear" button highlighted in green box, wait for the canvas to clear your drawn spiral.
8. Induce a mild tremor in your hand and try to follow the guide spiral as close as possible, this is best done by "faking" tremor symptoms by pretending to "shiver"
9. While in induced tremor state, trace the spiral from the center out and make sure to FOLLOW THE GUIDE SPIRAL AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE. This is to ensure your hand doesnt draw random scribbles as that's not representative of a real tremor test done by a patient.
10. Once finished with the spiral drawing, click on "Evaluate" button highlighted in green to see your results.
11. If everything done correctly, your message should read "You're exhibiting symptoms of Parkison's"
12. If you haven't gotten that message, please redo steps 6 - 10.
